This page is quick introducing what we might do for facilitator.

**Bug:** Storing module. (Currently it just store the string name of the module)

**Todo:** Sendgrip api or similar api for email reciving and auth.

**Todo:** Create different roles on frontend (currently all the users are admin, we might need to extend it to multiple role just like it in backend)
